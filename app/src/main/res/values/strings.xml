<!--Simple past tense-->
    <string name="SPTcrt">1. <b>Completed Actions</b> \n\nThe simple past tense is used to talk about actions or events that have already happened and are completed in the past. It is used to describe specific actions that occurred at a definite time in the past.\n\n
    2. <b>Time Marker</b>\n\nThe simple past tense is often used with time markers or expressions that indicate a specific time in the past, such as yesterday, last week, or in 1990.\n
    \n3. <b>Regular and Irregular Verbs</b> \n\nRegular verbs form the simple past tense by adding \u0027-ed\u0027 to the base form of the verb. Irregular verbs have their own unique forms in the simple past tense and do not follow the regular \u0027-ed\u0027 pattern.\n\n
    4. <b>No Connection to the Present</b> \n\nThe simple past tense indicates that the action or event took place in the past and does not have any connection to the present moment.\n\n
    5. <b>No Duration</b> \n\nThe simple past tense is used for actions or events that were completed in the past and are not ongoing or continuing. It does not indicate the duration of the action.\n\n
    6. <b>Reported Speech</b> \n\nThe simple past tense is often used when reporting someone\u0027s words or thoughts that were expressed in the past.\n\n

    <string name="SPTformstest">The simple past tense of a verb is used to <u>describe an action that happened in the past and is no longer happening</u>. In English, the simple past tense is formed by adding \u0027-ed\u0027 to the base form of regular verbs. However, irregular verbs have their own unique forms in the simple past tense and do not follow the regular \u0027-ed\u0027 pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Regular verb (walk): <font color="#FF0000">I</font> <font color="#673AB7">walked</font> to <font color="#4CAF50">the store.</font>\n- Irregular verb (go): <font color="#FF0000">I</font> <font color="#673AB7">went</font> to <font color="#4CAF50">the park</font>.\n\nIt\u0027s important to learn the past tense forms of verbs to communicate effectively in English.</string>

<!--    SIMPLE FUTURE TENSEILOLXD-->
    <string name="SFTcrt">1. <b>Expressing Future Actions</b>\n\n
The primary function of the simple future tense is to express actions or events that will happen after the present moment. It indicates that the action will take place in the future.\n\n

2. <b>Use of Auxiliary Verb</b>\n\n
The simple future tense is formed by using the auxiliary verb \u0027will\u0027 or \u0027shall\u0027 followed by the base form of the main verb. The choice between \u0027will\u0027 and \u0027shall\u0027 depends on the subject of the sentence and the speaker\u0027s intention.\n\n

3. <b>Subject-Verb Agreement</b>\n\n
The auxiliary verb \u0027will\u0027 or \u0027shall\u0027 is conjugated based on the subject of the sentence. For most subjects, the auxiliary verb \u0027will\u0027 is used. For the first person singular (\u0027I\u0027) and the first person plural (\u0027we\u0027), \u0027shall\u0027 can be used instead of \u0027will\u0027 to indicate a strong intention or a suggestion, though it is less common in modern English.\n\n

4. <b>Negation and Interrogation</b>\n\n
To form negative sentences in the simple future tense, the word \u0027not\u0027 is added after the auxiliary verb, or the contracted form \u0027won\u0027t\u0027 or \u0027shan\u0027t\u0027 is used. In interrogative sentences, the auxiliary verb is placed before the subject.\n\n

5. <b>No Time Stipulation</b>\n\n
The simple future tense does not indicate a specific time or duration. It focuses on actions or events that will occur in the future without specifying when they will happen.\n\n

6. <b>Plans, Predictions, Intentions, and Promises</b>\n\n
The simple future tense is commonly used to express plans, predictions, intentions, or promises. It allows speakers to talk about their future activities, make forecasts, state their intentions, or commit to certain actions.\n\n

7. <b>Adverbs of Time</b>\n\n
Adverbs of time can be used with the simple future tense to provide additional context about when the action will happen. For example, \u0027tomorrow,\u0027 \u0027next week,\u0027 or \u0027in the future\u0027 can be used to specify the timing of the future event.\n\n</string>
